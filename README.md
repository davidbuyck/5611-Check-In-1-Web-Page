## 1. Mouse Follow

[![Mouse Follow Pac-Man](https://img.youtube.com/vi/weyEFJS9z6c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weyEFJS9z6c)

Extra credit - Pacman has a constant maximum acceleration applied when you press the d or h buttons to speed up Pac-Man. An image of Pac-Man is displayed where the circle was and faces the pointer at all times. And image of open mouth and closed mouth Pac-Man are interchanged at a time interval to replicate Pac-Mans bite. WAKA WAKA

## 2. Simple Particle System

[![Simple Particle System](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OYxAPkRnB5o/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxAPkRnB5o)

Extra credit - Particles are deleted when they are alround too long with each particle having a life time variable. Dead particles are reborn from the spawn point. Color is increased over time where more green is added as the particle lives on. More Red is added with every bounce.

## 3. TCC Forces

[![TCC Forces](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qqsqel8n_s0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqsqel8n_s0)

Extra credit - Agents have a maximum force and maximum velocity for smooth motion. The two agents slightly colliding gracefully move apart from eachother. There is a static obsitcle that the agents all successfully avoid before gracefully stopping at their goals.

## 4. Breadth First and Depth First Tree Search

Extra credit - I have created a new graph with a cycle that will cause an infinte loop if not handled (pictured above). I added a maximum depth of 5 and now cycles will be handled. I also added iterative deepining breadth first search where a for loop increases the max depth each iteration until the goal is reached.

## 5. PRM

Extra credit - Lists of rectangles are supported with 3 added. Left click still changes the goal position but you can now click and hold the right mouse button to drag rectanges and circles.

No partners we used. 

I used Wikipedia for the DFS pseudocode.
