## 4. Breadth First and Depth First Tree Search

Extra credit - I have created a new graph with a cycle that will cause an infinte loop if not handled (pictured above). I added a maximum depth of 5 and now cycles will be handled. I also added iterative deepining breadth first search where a for loop increases the max depth each iteration until the goal is reached.


No partners we used. 

I used Wikipedia for the DFS pseudocode.
